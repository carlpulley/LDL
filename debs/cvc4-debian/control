Package: cvc4
Architecture: any
Depends: libcvc4-3 (= ${binary:Version}), libcvc4parser3 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Automated theorem prover for SMT problems
 This package contains the CVC4 binaries.
 .
 CVC4 is a tool for determining the satisfiability of a first order formula
 modulo a first order theory (or a combination of such theories). It is the
 fourth in the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools (CVC, CVC Lite,
 CVC3) but does not directly incorporate code from any previous version.
 .
 CVC4 is intended to be an open and extensible SMT engine. It can be used
 as a stand-alone tool or as a library. It has been designed to increase
 the performance and reduce the memory overhead of its predecessors.

Package: libcvc4-3
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: CVC4 dynamic libraries
 This package contains the CVC4 dynamic libraries.  "libcvc4.so" contains
 the main CVC4 prover API.
